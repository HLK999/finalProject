Final WDI Project: framed

**Description**
A captioned-photo gallery to be used for any group—be it a workplace, school, club, a meetup group, or family. My sample cohort hangs out in Washington Square Park

**Purpose**
Oft times members of newly-formed groups like to know a little bit about their peers, be it simply linking their faces with their names, or a bit more. Though fairly static (at least in its current state), this app is meant to be a personalized reference so that group members have an easy and fun way to remember each other.

Also, names are rather arbitrary. Unless your moniker is the Jolly Green Giant, it probably isn't that descriptive. But a visual with a name helps concretize the name, and additional bio tidbits are all to the better, as well.

**Requirement**

One or more designated photographer(s) and “reporters,” quite possibly one and the same person. (A variation could have people submitting their own photos, but I rather like the idea of a consistent visual aesthetic.)

**What the User Will See**

I’ll take a portrait and ask the subject to answer the first four bio lines: name, birthplace, first language, and dream job.

Then I’ll ask several icebreaker questions, beginning with one that my younger son, Jack, asked me when he was six. The subject then can then, if he or she wants, submit additional autobiographic content within the bounds of the two additional questions.

If possible, others within the group will be able to add emojis, check marks, or brief text. This "commentary" is the extent to which others would use the app viz. other profiles, at least as of now. (Update: as of 12.17.15, I have not added this functionality... and I'm rather on the fence about doing it at all.)

**Users will be able to:**
-- sign in
-- create a profile as described above
<<<<<<< HEAD
-- log in to view or edit their profiles AND, importantly, view the profiles of their peers, whether by clicking on their pix or names
--edit/update or delete their own profiles (they cannot perform these actions on the profiles of others)
--PhotoShop the hell out of their portraits
--No avatars allowed: the photo must be a current, recognizable shot of each member of the group. A mugshot is okay, but that may well be TMI, especially if the cohort is in your new job. ; - )
